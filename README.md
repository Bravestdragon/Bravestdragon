Hello! I’m Marei Ignecious Seolwana, a dedicated computer science student at Zhejiang Normal University with a passion for developing dynamic, user-focused applications.
My technical strengths lie in JavaFX, Java EE, JavaScript, and Node.js, which I use to bring ideas to life — from elegant desktop interfaces to full-stack web applications.

I believe that great software blends creativity, logic, and empathy for the user. I’m always open to learning, collaborating, and contributing to projects that challenge me to grow as a developer.

Let’s build something amazing together! ✨
